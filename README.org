* Git GUI

This little project visualizes the git commit graph in the browser.
It is in very early stages of development and probably at the moment
only works for me.

** To Do

Too much to mention but here is a higher goal list:

- Make the setup user friendly
- Make the selecting and refreshing of the repository available through the browser
- Convert to using cl-git
- Getting rid of sbcl dependency
- Add montezuma search capabilities
- Add gui for selecting multiple revisions
- Add gui for selecting and storing dead revisions
- Improve the look and feel of the web pages, they are very very plain right now.
- etc. ...
