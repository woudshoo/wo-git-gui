* Git GUI

This little project visualizes the git commit graph in the browser.
It is in very early stages of development and probably at the moment
only works for me.

** Initial setup

The quickest way to start is using quicklisp and do the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
    (ql:quickload "wo-git-gui")
    (setf wo-git-gui:*git-project* "/Users/woudshoo/Development/Source/lisp-devel-systems/cl-git/.git")
    (wo-git-gui:read-graph)
    (wo-git-gui:start-server)
#+END_SRC
This will start an hunchentoot server on localhost port 8988.
So after starting the server you can point your browser to:
[[http://localhost:8988/neighborhood-graph]]


This assumes that the system can find the git and dot executables.
The paths to these are specified with
#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
     (setf wo-git:*git-command* "/usr/bin/git")
     (setf wo-git-gui:*dot-cmd* "/usr/bin/dot")
#+END_SRC

** To Do

Too much to mention but here is a higher goal list:

- Make the setup user friendly
- Make the selecting and refreshing of the repository available through the browser
- Convert to using cl-git
- Getting rid of sbcl dependency
- Add montezuma search capabilities
- Add gui for selecting multiple revisions
- Add gui for selecting and storing dead revisions
- Improve the look and feel of the web pages, they are very very plain right now.
- etc. ...
